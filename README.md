# Getting Started with Chart App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### Task:
Create a React app with a chart component.
The chart shows the average time spent by a user per page. Here is a design example:
Your chart should match this concept. Indents and colors are not important, but should follow the main concept of UX..

#### Initial Input data:
[{ name: "Landing Page", time: 7.4 },
{ name: "Configurator", time: 0.2 },
{ name: "Check-out", time: 7.0 },
{ name: "Deal", time: 3.8 }]
#### Requirements:
● Chart should have a button, when you click on it data should be changed randomly.
● Button above should have autoclick every 0.53 min.
● Chart should be responsive - Iphone X to retina screen (2880 × 1800).
● Use font-family Roboto, font-size 16px for text and 20px for title.
(Please do not forget that this font is not available as standard)
● App can be builded without any warnings.
● Components and containers of app covered with the tests.
